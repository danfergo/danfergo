Sensing contacts throughout the entire finger, is anhighly valuable capability for a robot to perform manipulationtasks,  as  vision-based  sensing  often  suffers  from  occlusions  orinaccurate  estimations.  Current  tactile  sensors  represent  oneof  two  compromises:  low  resolution  readings,  or  a  limitedcontact  measurement  area.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  finger-shaped  optical  sensor  that  has  the  shape  of  a  finger  and  cansense  contacts  on  any  location  of  its  surface.  Our  extensiveexperiments  show  that  the  sensor  can  effectively  localise  thesecontacts  at  different  locations  of  its  finger  body,  with  a  smalllocalisation error of approximately 5mm, on average, and under1mm in the best cases. Furthermore, our grasping experimentsdemonstrate  the  advantages  of  leveraging  touch  sensing  inmanipulation  tasks,  together  with  remote  sensing  capabilities,such  as  vision
